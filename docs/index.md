Explainable face recognition is the problem of providing an interpretable reasoning for the outputs of a face recognition system.  This software distribution accompanies the arXiv paper:

J. Williford, B. May and J. Byrne, "Explainable Face Recognition", ECCV 2020, [arXiv:2008.00916](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00916.pdf)

In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive benchmark for explainable face recognition (XFR), and make the following contributions:

* Discriminative saliency maps.  We introduce benchmark algorithms for discriminative visualization for both whitebox (convolutional network exposed) and blackbox (matching scores only) face recognition systems.  
* Inpainting game protocol.  We define a standardized evaluation protocol for fine grained discriminative visualization of faces.
* Inpainting game dataset for facial recognition.  We publicly release the inpainting game dataset, algorithms and baseline results to support reproducible research.
